# Lecture

## Learning material

Welcome to the lecture **Micromechanics**. You can find here learning material specifically targeted for this class. The goal of the material is to prepare you for the solution of the problem sets and the final exam. You should also use other source of information, e.g. book. Wikipedia also contains useful information on the subject matter of this class.

We provide two kinds of learning material:
* Lecture videos
* Written text, that you can download [here](Micromechanics.pdf) as a single PDF file

The material is structured along weeks to define a pace with which you should study the material. You can of course also go through the material faster, but please try to keep up and not fall behind the schedule.

## Contents

This class teaches the following subjects:
* Static equilibrium of beam systems
